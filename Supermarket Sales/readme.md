## Supermarket Sales ##

**Introduction**

In this project, I made an interactive dashboard from a data I got from Kaggle. The data is available on [Supermarket Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales)

This analysis examines the number of sales by hour, the number of sales by branch, the number of sales by payment method, the most popular product category, and the median rating for each product. By conducting this analysis, a supermarket owner can make business decisions that will increase profits and expand the company's business.

For example, knowing the median rating by product allows an owner to deliver a product that exceeds their customers' expectations. It is critical for data analysts to be a part of every industry in the world in order to bring new ideas to every business.
